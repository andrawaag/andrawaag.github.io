1. Go to [andrawaag.github.io/tarsier](https://andrawaag.github.io/tarsier) ![start screen](https://github.com/andrawaag/andrawaag.github.io/blob/main/tarsier/images/Screenshot%202022-01-28%20at%2000-53-49%20Tarsier%20GBIF%20image%20search.png)
2. Type the scientific name of a taxon for which you would like to search a reusable license (i.e. one with CC0, CC-BY, and CC-BY-SA) and press/click SUBMIT ![2nd screen](https://github.com/andrawaag/andrawaag.github.io/blob/main/tarsier/images/Screenshot%202022-01-28%20at%2000-57-01%20Tarsier%20GBIF%20image%20search.png)
4. Select one of the institutes to inspect the available image on the species. (Due to limitations installed on Wikimedia Commons only a select group of domains are allowed to transfer images from the domain to commons. A list of allowed domains is maintained on the [project page](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:WikiProject_Biodiversity#Tarsier_GBIF_image_search). 
5. Select on of the hosting institutes or CitSci initiatives. A list of max 20 images are rendered. If the associated license to a given image has compatible license with Wikimedia Commons, a upload link will be available. ![3rd screen](https://github.com/andrawaag/andrawaag.github.io/blob/main/tarsier/images/Screenshot%202022-01-28%20at%2001-03-34%20Tarsier%20GBIF%20image%20search.png)
6. Follow the upload link to a page with details on the image ![4th screen](https://github.com/andrawaag/andrawaag.github.io/blob/main/tarsier/images/Screenshot%202022-01-28%20at%2001-04-20%20Tarsier%20GBIF%20image%20search.png).

9. Scroll to the bottom of the commons page and submit the file by clicking on the "Upload file button".
