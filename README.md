1. Go to [andrawaag.github.io/tarsier](https://andrawaag.github.io/tarsier)
2. Type the scientific name of a taxon for which you would like to search a reusable license (i.e. one with CC0, CC-BY, and CC-BY-SA) and press/click SUBMIT
3. Select one of the institutes to inspect the available image on the species. (Due to limitations installed Wikimedia Commons only a select group of domains are allowed to transfer images from the domain to commons. A list of allowed domains is maintained on the [project page](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:WikiProject_Biodiversity#Tarsier_GBIF_image_search)
4. Select on of the hosting institutes or CitSci initiatives. A list of max 20 images are rendered. If the associated license to a given image has compatible license with Wikimedia Commons, a upload link will be available.

6. Follow the link upload2commons to transfer the selected image to commons
7. Scroll to the bottom of the commons page and submit the file by clicking on the "Upload file button". Again the upload will only succeed if the source is listed as an [approved domain](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Upload_tools/wgCopyUploadsDomains)
